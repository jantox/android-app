Utility Bill Splitter
=====================

This application was created to properly split utility bills (water, electricity, gas, etc) among renters in a single flat.
The calculation for the payment will be "bill per renter = (Total Bill / Total days spent by all renters) * the days spent by the renter".
      
There are many ways to spit utility bills, but this is the one we are currently using.
